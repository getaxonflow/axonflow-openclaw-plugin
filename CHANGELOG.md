# Changelog

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **`AxonFlowHttpError` typed error class** exported from `src/axonflow-client.ts`. Carries `.status`, `.statusText`, and `.responseBody` as dedicated fields. The client now throws this on any non-403 HTTP failure from `mcpCheckInput` / `mcpCheckOutput`, so downstream consumers can reliably check the HTTP status without pattern-matching the error message string. Previous code path threw a plain `Error` with the status number embedded in the message text, which forced `isAxonFlowAuthError` in `governance.ts` to use fragile substring matching (fine in practice because the v1.2.0 message format happened to include the status digits, but one refactor away from a silent classifier regression).

### Changed

- **`isAxonFlowAuthError` tightened with word-boundary regex.** The v1.2.0 classifier used raw `String.includes()` checks, which matched "auth" inside "author" / "authority" / "authoritative". Now uses a single regex with `\b` word boundaries for `401`, `403`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `credentials`, `auth(entication|orization)?`, and `(invalid|expired)[_ -]?token`. The previous special-case exclusion for `"auth server"` is no longer needed.
- Classifier checks the typed `.status` / `.statusCode` path first; the regex fallback is only used for errors that don't expose an HTTP status field (third-party fetch wrappers, legacy code).

### Tests

- New regression test in `tests/axonflow-client.test.ts` asserts that non-403 failures throw `AxonFlowHttpError` with `.status` populated (using `instanceof` + field check). This guards the "classifier must work via `.status`, not just message match" invariant.
- Existing throw-test assertions updated to use a regex matcher (`/check-input failed.*500/`) instead of exact substring, since the error message format now includes "HTTP \<status\>".

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Smart error classification in governance hooks.** `before_tool_call` now distinguishes network/transport errors (timeouts, DNS failures, connection refused, HTTP 5xx) from auth/config errors (HTTP 401/403, invalid credentials, invalid tokens). **Network errors always fail-open** regardless of `config.onError` — transient infrastructure issues should never block legitimate dev workflows. **Auth errors respect `config.onError`** which defaults to `block` so misconfigured credentials are caught at the first tool call. This replaces the previous all-or-nothing `onError` behavior.

### Added

- **`isAxonFlowAuthError(err)` exported helper** classifies thrown errors from the AxonFlow client. Applications can use it to implement their own fail-open / fail-closed logic outside the built-in hook.
- 11 new unit tests cover the auth-vs-network classification on the governance hook path and the standalone classifier.

### Security

- Pinned all GitHub Actions in test and publish workflows to immutable commit SHAs to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Added Dependabot configuration for weekly GitHub Actions updates.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- `requestTimeoutMs` plugin config for tuning AxonFlow HTTP request timeouts on remote or high-latency deployments.
- Plugin logo for marketplace and directory listings.
- `SECURITY.md` with plugin-specific vulnerability reporting guidance.

### Changed

- Anonymous telemetry is enabled by default for all endpoints, including localhost/self-hosted evaluation. Opt out with `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `AXONFLOW_TELEMETRY=off`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **`X-Tenant-ID` header removed.** The plugin no longer sends `X-Tenant-ID`. The server derives tenant from OAuth2 Client Credentials (Basic auth). Requires platform v6.0.0+.
- **`tenantId` config removed.** Both `clientId` and `clientSecret` default to `"community"` when not configured. The `tenantId` field is removed — tenant is derived server-side.

### Added

- `searchAuditEvents()` method on `AxonFlowClient` for individual audit event inspection. Enables debugging why something was blocked, generating compliance reports, and answering "what did the agent do in the last hour?"
- Hardened E2E test suite: 24 tests covering dangerous command blocking (reverse shell, rm -rf, SSRF, path traversal, credential access), PII detection with redaction assertions, and audit search.

### Security

- Bumped `@anthropic-ai/sdk` transitive dependency from 0.80.0 to 0.82.0 (fixes CVE-2026-34451: memory tool path validation sandbox escape).
- Replaced polynomial regex in endpoint URL normalization with iterative loop (ReDoS mitigation).
- Added explicit `permissions: contents: read` to CI workflow (least privilege).
- Removed hardcoded Base64 auth string from test file (secret scanning false positive).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01 (initial public release)

### Added

- `before_tool_call` hook: evaluates tool arguments against AxonFlow policies before execution. Blocks dangerous commands, detects PII in tool input, enforces rate limits.
- `after_tool_call` hook: logs every tool execution to AxonFlow's audit trail for compliance evidence.
- `message_sending` hook: scans outbound messages to user channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp) for PII and secrets. Can cancel or redact before delivery.
- `llm_input` hook: records prompt, model, and provider at the start of each LLM call to AxonFlow's audit trail.
- `llm_output` hook: records LLM response, token usage, and latency. Correlates with `llm_input` for complete LLM call audit entries.
- High-risk tool approval: configurable tool list triggers OpenClaw's native approval flow even when AxonFlow allows the call.
- Configurable governance scope: govern all tools, specific tools only, or exclude specific tools.
- Fail-open/fail-closed: `onError` config controls behavior when AxonFlow is unreachable.
- **Startup health check**: Verifies AxonFlow connectivity on plugin initialization. Logs a warning if unreachable, indicating whether the plugin will fail-open or fail-closed.
- **Governance metrics**: In-process counters for tool calls (evaluated, blocked, approved, allowed), messages (scanned, cancelled, redacted), audit events, and errors. Accessible via `getMetrics()` for debugging and monitoring.
- **Usage telemetry**: Anonymous checkpoint ping on initialization reporting SDK version, platform info, and hook configuration. Respects `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` and `AXONFLOW_TELEMETRY=off`.
- Starter policy documentation with SQL setup for OpenClaw production baseline.

### Not Yet Supported

- Tool result transcript scanning: OpenClaw's `tool_result_persist` hook is sync-only, preventing async HTTP calls to AxonFlow. Upstream issue filed (openclaw/openclaw#58558). Outbound messages ARE scanned via `message_sending`.
